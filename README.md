With this todo app you can create, edit and delete any task you like and add them as favorite as well.

The backend of this server runs in a fakeAPIRest called [JSON-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), more instructions down bellow.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

After downloading the repo remember to:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. also opens the JSON server in port [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

If the multipleTodo(when 2 or more task are selected to being deleted) did not refresh automaticaly after deleting the todos please refresh the page as the changes are already applied.

### `npm test`

To test using jestJS

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run storybook`

The storybook where installed as dependency but no change were applied because i have no knowledge about this module ! So no changes where done with this npm module.
