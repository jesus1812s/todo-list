# Getting Started with Todo app

With this todo app you can create, edit and delete any task you like and add them as favorite as well.

The backend of this server runs in a fakeAPIRest called [JSON-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), more instructions down bellow.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. also opens the JSON server in port [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

If the multipleTodo(when 2 or more task are selected to being deleted) did not refresh automaticaly after deleting the todos please refresh the page as the changes are already applied.

### `npm test`

To test using jestJS

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run storybook`

The storybook where installed as dependency but no change were applied because i have no knowledge about this module ! So no changes where done with this npm module.
